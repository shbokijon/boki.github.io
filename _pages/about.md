I am currently a seismology Ph.D. student in the Department of [Earth and Space Sciences (ESS)](https://ess.washington.edu) at the University of Washington. I am also a duty seismologist in the [Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN)](https://pnsn.org).

The overall goal of my research is to advance our knowledge of monitoring earthquakes and near-surface structure by leveraging heterogeneous datasets from seismic stations and fiber-optic sensing. A core focus of my research is the development of new tools that empower cloud computing for big seismic data storing, processing, and analysis. My recent study is about time-lapse imaging of shallow subsurface using a dark fiber in the northern Seattle region.
